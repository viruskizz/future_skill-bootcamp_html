    <strong>Final Fantasy XII</strong> is the twelfth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Square Enix, and the fourth game set in the world of Ivalice. 
    It was released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and was later re-released in Japan as an international version titled Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System, with heavy changes made to the character development system by introducing jobs. 
    This version was re-released worldwide for PlayStation 4 in July 2017, and for Steam in February 2018, as an HD remaster containing new updates, titled Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. 
    Final Fantasy XII was directed by Hiroyuki Ito, who also designed the battle system and supervised The Zodiac Age, with Akihiko Yoshida designing the main characters and Hitoshi Sakimoto producing the musical score. Later, on April 30, 2019 it was released for Nintendo Switch with minor updates.

    The game is set in the continent of Ivalice, in which the Archadian and Rozarrian Empires wage an endless war for power, and Dalmasca has been caught between the two and annexed by Archadia. Dalmasca's princess, Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca, has created a resistance movement against Archadia to avenge her fallen kingdom, and along the way is united with a band of allies to seek a power capable of defeating the Archadian Empire.

    Final Fantasy XII features vastly different gameplay from previous entries, with the most notable differences being the elimination of random encounters in favor of engaging enemies on the field with no separate battle screen using the Active Dimension Battle system. 
    Characters are controlled with menu commands, or programmed using a gambit system. By purchasing licenses on a License Board with LP, characters can unlock the ability to equip new weapons, armor and accessories, as well as to make use of abilities such as White Magicks, Black Magicks, Time Magicks, Green Magicks, Arcane Magicks and Technicks. In the original, each character uses the same License Board, but in the Zodiac releases, different License Boards are used for different jobs, with characters each assigned a job. 
    Locations are connected by an open world rather than a world map, with many side quests available to the player, such as Hunts.
